# Reward Points Calculation Service

This Spring Boot application calculates monthly and total reward points for customers based on their transaction amounts. It provides RESTful APIs to fetch rewards and add new transactions.

## Problem Statement

Retailers want to reward customers based on their purchase amounts:

- For every dollar spent **over $50**, the customer receives **1 point**.
- For every dollar spent **over $100**, the customer receives an **additional 1 point** (i.e., 2 points for every dollar over $100).

### Example Calculation

If a customer makes a transaction of **$120**:
- The first $50 gets **0 points**.
- The next $50 (from $51 to $100) gets **1 point per dollar → 50 points**.
- The last $20 (from $101 to $120) gets **2 points per dollar → 40 points**.

**Total = 50 + 40 = 90 points**
